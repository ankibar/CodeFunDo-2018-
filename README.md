# CodeFunDo-2018-
The topic this year is the prediction of natural disasters. While one could check for vibrations in the crust, rise in water levels
change in wind speeds etc as signs of a coming natural disaster, they might not be enough to warn us.
As a result, I think we can look for more early, more subtle changes in the earth visually. For my project, I will be working on pre-existing datasets that will be trained using ML algorithms and imaage processing for the "vision" part using OpenCV and other related libraries. I will be updating this readme file with more insights as I go along. Till then, I hope this suffices.
